# pnm-implementation
My implementation of the PNM format in C. The library is meant to read and write a .pnm image.

## Requirements
- ar
- clang

## Building
Running `./build` in the main directory will produce a library in a new `lib` directory containing the implementation from `src`.

## Fixes and TODO
- Haven't gotten around to all of the pnm image types, but those not supported will say so
